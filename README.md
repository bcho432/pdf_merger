PDF Merging app created by Bryan Cho


This program allows users to merge two existing PDF files by simply 
1) Uploading the first PDF
2) Uploading the second PDF
3) Inputting the page location which the second PDF will be added onto the first PDF
4) (Optional) Add page numbers (feature) to the bottom left of the page if needed
5) Then press 'Merge PDFs' and the merged PDF will be automatically downloaded onto Chrome

Unfortunately, this is not a web development, so to use this code, please download these files onto a coding application (GitHub makes this very easy) and run it on your local host.
